backbone-postgresql
===================

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/bjpirt/backbone-postgresql.png)](http://travis-ci.org/bjpirt/backbone-postgresql)

This is a sync library for Backbone.js running on node.js on the server that enables it to store data in PostgreSQL. It uses a hybrid approach to the schema where you can mix up old-school columns with all of their associated relational integrity and an hstore column that allows you to store arbitrary attributes with no schema changes. It's still a work in progress and until I flesh out this readme the best place to find out how to use it is in the examples.
